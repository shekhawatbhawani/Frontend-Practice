                        Frontend Practice offers developers the opportunity to practice and improve their skills in
                        design, interactions, animations, responsiveness, troubleshooting, and more by providing a
                        selection of real websites for them to recreate from scratch. This hands-on approach allows
                        developers to gain a diverse set of valuable skills that will make them more employable in the
                        industry.

                    <p>
                        Pexels and Pixabay are excellent sources for free stock photos, while Boxicons and Font Awesome
                        offer a variety of free
                        icons. Links to these resources can be found at the top of every project page on Frontend
                        Practice.

                    <p>
                        Frontend Practice does not provide any pre-written code, but we do offer a few resources to
                        assist with each project.
                        However, there will always be unexpected challenges that arise during the learning process,
                        which is where the true
                        learning begins.

                    <p>
                        If you want a more structured approach to learning coding, consider taking Frontend Masters'
                        "Complete Intro to Web
                        Development" or "Getting Started With CSS" courses, which are completely free.

                        Frontend Masters offers a variety of programming courses that are perfect for developers looking
                        to improve their
                        skills. From foundational concepts to advanced techniques, these courses cover a wide range of
                        topics and are suitable
                        for developers at all levels.

                        In short, you can use any programming language you desire for these practice projects.

                        The beauty of recreating websites for practice is that you can utilize any tech stack, such as
                        HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                        React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or any other language, framework, or library.

                    <p>
                        The selection of websites featured on Frontend Practice is based on personal preference and
                        takes into consideration
                        various factors, including design and style, difficulty to recreate, and elements and features
                        that offer a learning
                        opportunity through recreation.

                        It is important to note that some projects may be more challenging to recreate than others.

                    <p>
                        We encourage you to make these projects your own by incorporating your own colors, content, and
                        images. If you choose to
                        use these projects for your portfolio, please clearly state that it is an "unofficial" version.

                        It is important to note that these are practice projects and all materials owned by companies
                        and individuals whose
                        websites are featured on Frontend Practice are intended for practice purposes only.

                    <p>
                        How dare they update the website! We will talk with their manager right away. If they don't
                        respond, we'll periodically
                        check the websites we feature and make the necessary updates.

                        In some cases, if we really love the previous design, we may keep it and link to an archived
                        page if possible. If not,
                        please see the reference image on the project page.

                        Occasionally we will retire projects from the main collection if the design is no longer up to

                        version is not available.

                        You can still find the retired projects at the bottom of our Projects page.
